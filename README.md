# Bike_Rentals_Predictor
This was an attempt to complete a past Kaggle data science competition. 2 years worth of data were given and the task was to predict the number of bycle rentals that would occur on any given hour for future dates. 

This was completed in a team of 3 as part of cs4661 an Introduction to Data Science course. GitHub link will be posted shortly.It was a regression problem. Linear Regression, KNN Regression, Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression, ADA BOOST, PCA, and XGB Boost were applied to solve the problem. A presentation powerpoint as well as a report were also completed with this project. Although, our results did not make any major breakthroughs it was a great experience in solving real world problems with data science and machine learning tools. The code was all completed in python.
